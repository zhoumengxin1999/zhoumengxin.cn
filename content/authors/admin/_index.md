I once heard of a story of a mathematics teacher who drew a straight line on the blackboard and extended it beyond the classroom, leading the students to experience the infinite extension of a straight line. Marvelled at the enlightenment that could be achieved through mathematics education, I have long yearned for becoming such a kind of mathematics teacher who can impart mathematical knowledge to students through methods of guidance and inspiration while overturning their stereotype that mathematics is a boring and mechanical discipline composed of definitions, formulas, and theorems.
